## Features

- [x] Backup and restore apps (experimental, currently broken due to API change)
- [x] Set backup password
- [x] Backup to custom path and restore from there
- [x] Increment backup (menu -> backup -> load checkpoint)

## Special Note

This app was previously designed to be a paid app, but we are unable to provide reliable service on application backup/restore, and we have stopped developing or maintaining this app. We are open-sourcing this project to let the community continue the development.
